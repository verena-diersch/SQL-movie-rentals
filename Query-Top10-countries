Here is a SQL query which acts as a building block for subqueries (such as Top-10-cities and Top-5-customers)

-- Top 10 countries customers are located in

SELECT D. country,
       COUNT (customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY number_of_customers DESC
LIMIT 10;
