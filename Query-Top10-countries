Here is a SQL query which acts as a building block for subqueries (such as Top-10-cities and Top-5-customers)

-- Top 10 countries customers are located in

select D. country,
       count (customer_id) as number_of_customers
from customer A
inner join address B on A.address_id = B.address_id
inner join city C on B.city_id = C.city_id
inner join country D on C.country_id = D.country_id
group by country
order by number_of_customers desc
limit 10;
