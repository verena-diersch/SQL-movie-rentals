Here is a SQL query with a common table expression:

-- Most successful genres

WITH customer_country AS 
(SELECT customer.customer_id AS customer_id,
        country.country AS country
FROM customer
JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id)
SELECT customer_country.country AS country,
       SUM(rental_revenue_category.payment) AS revenue,
	     rental_revenue_category.genre AS genre
FROM 
(SELECT r.customer_id AS customer_id,
	      p.amount AS payment,
	      c.name AS genre
FROM payment p
JOIN rental r ON p.rental_id = r.rental_id
JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
JOIN film_category fc ON i.film_id = fc.film_id
JOIN category c ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY r.customer_id, payment, c.name) AS rental_revenue_category
JOIN customer_country ON rental_revenue_category.customer_id = customer_country.customer_id
GROUP BY country, genre
ORDER BY genre DESC;
