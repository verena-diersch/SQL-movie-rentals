inner join country d on c.country_id = d.country_id
group by d.country

)

select  co.country as country,
        cc.customer_count as customer_count,
		    sum(p.amount) as revenue

inner join rental r on p.rental_id = r.rental_id
inner join customer c on r.customer_id = c.customer_id
inner join address a on c.address_id = a.address_id
inner join city ci ON a.city_id = ci.city_id
