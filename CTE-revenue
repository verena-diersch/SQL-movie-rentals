Here is a SQL query with a common table expression

-- Top 10 countries based on revenue

WITH customer_count AS 
(SELECT d.country AS country,
       	COUNT(a.customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM customer a
JOIN address b ON a.address_id = b.address_id
JOIN city c ON c.city_id = b.city_id
JOIN country d ON c.country_id = d.country_id
GROUP BY d.country)
SELECT  co.country AS country,
        cc.customer_count AS customer_count,
		    SUM(p.amount) AS revenue
FROM payment p
JOIN rental r ON p.rental_id = r.rental_id
JOIN customer c ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN address a ON c.address_id = a.address_id
JOIN city ci ON a.city_id = ci.city_id
JOIN country co ON ci.country_id = co.country_id
JOIN customer_count cc ON cc.country = co.country
GROUP BY co.country, customer_count
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
