# SQL-movie-rentals
SQL analysis of a worldwide video rental platform

This is a student project I did in my data analytics bootcamp. Using pgadmin 4 I wrote SQL queries in which I asked questions like:

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- Which countries are Rockbuster (the movie rental firm) based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

The project brief can be found in elsewhere in this repository.

The data can be accessed through a link in the project brief.

My Tableau storyboard for this project can be found under this link: [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/verena.diersch/viz/RockbusterDataAnalysis\_16348000092110/RockbusterDataAnalysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/verena.diersch/viz/RockbusterDataAnalysis_16348000092110/RockbusterDataAnalysis)
