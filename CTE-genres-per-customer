Here is a SQL query with a common table expression:

-- Most succesful genre per customer

with cte as (

select 
   customer.customer_id, 
   category.name,
   row_number() over (partition by customer.customer_id order by count (category.name) desc) rn
from customer
inner join rental on rental.customer_id = customer.customer_id
inner join inventory on rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
inner join film on inventory.film_id = film.film_id
inner join film_category on film.film_id = film_category.film_id
inner join category on film_category.category_id = category.category_id
group by customer.customer_id, category.name)

select
    customer_id,
    name
from cte where rn = 1
